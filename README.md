`Analysing Opportunities for investment and growth in Tellco Telecommunications`

### Situational Overview (Business Need)

> You are working for a wealthy investor that specializes in purchasing assets that are
  undervalued. This investor’s due diligence on all purchases includes a rich analysis of
  the data that underlies the business, to try to understand the fundamentals of the
  business and especially to identify opportunities to drive profitability by changing the
  focus of which products or services are being offered.

> Your last role with this investor saw you do a rich analysis of a delivery company and you
  helped to identify that delivery to university students was the most profitable route to
  follow, and your analysis helped the investor purchase this delivery company and ramp
  up profits by 25% within 6 months through focussing on the most profitable aspect of the
  business. This was driven by university students always being hungry, awake at all
  hours, willing to purchase from a limited food menu and tending to live within a small
  geographical area.
  
> The investor is interested in purchasing TellCo, an existing mobile service provider in the
  Republic of Pefkakia. TellCo’s current owners have been willing to share their financial
  information but have never employed anyone to look at their data that is generated
  automatically by their systems.
  
> Your employer wants you to provide a report to analyze opportunities for growth and
  make a recommendation on whether TellCo is worth buying or selling. You will do this
  by analyzing a telecommunication dataset that contains useful information about the
  customers & their activities on the network​
